Coursework for SNHU CS-360
Stack N Stock is a mobile inventory management app that was built to help users easily track and organize inventory stock items. Each user has a secure login tied to a unique database, ensuring private, persistent data across user sessions. The goal was to create a compact power house for everyday use that handles core inventory tasks reliably.
The app flow includes a login screen, signup for new user accounts, and a main inventory screen where items can be added, viewed, adjusted, or deleted. A RecyclerView is used to render lists efficiently, keeping the interface scalable as inventories grow. Navigation here placed an emphasis on recognition over recall with consistent button placement, clear labels, and clearly defined routes back to home or logout.
Development strictly followed a test-driven approach, molding functions around test cases to confirm functionality. The database was made to be modular, with separate files for initialization, user accounts, and inventory management, which greatly simplified the debugging process. Early visualization of layouts balanced project requirements with standard design practices, while modular code and prototyping makes the app easier to extend in the future.
Testing combined emulator runs with intentional function validation. This highlighted the importance of persisting user data and ensuring the app always returned to the login screen when closed.  The biggest challenges encountered were structuring the database for multiple users and designing seamless navigation, both of which required careful planning, iteration, and ibuprofen.
The projectâ€™s strongest success came during design and planning. Starting with a clearly defined mission and adapting as challenges arose allowed Stack N Stock to meet user needs with a reliable, user-friendly inventory tracker that demonstrated both coding skill and thoughtful UI/UX design.
